    <h1> TV Header made up story</h1>
    <p>People these days „Influencers, Stars,Music artists” and 
        all different kind of people search for the perfectionism to fill the lack of Ambition,beauty,
        success or what ever their gab is;
         They always strive and hunger for this feeling, that they will never reach, because no matter 
         what you do and what you achieve happiness is always the “inner-feeling “ and it exists in every
          human from the birth until death and people have issues finding this feeling, so they fill it with smoking or
           face surgery or any other addiction, that gives them some amount of dopamine.
        We live in this fucked up society and we had ENOUGH.
        Therefore we came up with a great idea, instead of striving to the perfectionism, 
        why don't we be the perfectionism, which means accepting yourself no matter, where, who, what you are, 
        YOU ARE PERFECT and creating a symbol, which is the old TV as our head to tell these “kids”,
         who aim for one goal and it's Perfectionism, that WE are the definition of Perfectionism no matter what your thoughts,
          circumstances, standards and expectations from the Perfectionism are.
